            <p id="paragraph1">The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money-laundering operation.</p>
            <p id="paragraph2">The film received multiple award nominations (including seven Oscar nominations) and highly positive reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. Through Ted Turners acquisition of Castle Rock Entertainment, the film started gaining more popularity in 1997 after it started near-daily airings on Turners TNT network. It is now considered to be one of the greatest films of the 1990s</p>
